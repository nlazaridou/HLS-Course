## 1st programming Assignment

### Exercise 1
Write a C++ function that takes a 32-bit (unsigned int) value and **counts the number of bits equal to 1**. That value is returned in a 16-bit (unsigned short int) number. Prepare a testbench that will verify the correctness of the function for pseudo-random inputs.

### Exercise 2
Calculate the **checksum of an unsigned int number**, as follows: Starting from right to left, you add up the digits from 0 to 9 in decimal representation. For every other digit instead of itself you add its double to the sum. If the double is a two-digit number then add to the sum the sum of the digits. 
*For example: 3561 => (6)+5+(1+2)+1=15.*
Again, prepare a testbench to ensure the proper function of your program.
